        <h1>Paradise City</h1>
        <i>by Guns N' Roses</i>
        <p>
            [Chorus]
            Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
            Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty<br>
            Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)<br>
            Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
            Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty<br>
            Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)<br><br>
            
            [Instrumental Break]<br><br>
            
            [Verse 1]<br>
            Just a' urchin livin' under the street, I'm a<br>
            Hard case that's tough to beat<br>
            I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat<br>
            I'll pay you at another time<br>
            Take it to the end of the line<br><br>
            
            [Verse 2]<br>
            Rags to riches, or so they say, you gotta<br>
            Keep pushin' for the fortune and fame<br>
            You know it's- it's all a gamble when it's just a game<br>
            You treat it like a capital crime<br>
            Everybody's doin' the time<br><br>
            
            [Chorus]<br>
            Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
            Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty<br>
            Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah, yeah<br>
            Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
            Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty<br>
            Take me home
