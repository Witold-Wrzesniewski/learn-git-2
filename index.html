    <h1>Paradise City</h1>
    <i>by Guns N' Roses</i>
    <p>
        [Chorus]
        Take me down to the Paradise City
        Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
        Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)
        Take me down to the Paradise City
        Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
        Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)
        
        [Instrumental Break]
        
        [Verse 1]
        Just a' urchin livin' under the street, I'm a
        Hard case that's tough to beat
        I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat
        I'll pay you at another time
        Take it to the end of the line
        
        [Verse 2]
        Rags to riches, or so they say, you gotta
        Keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
        You know it's- it's all a gamble when it's just a game
        You treat it like a capital crime
        Everybody's doin' the time
        
        [Chorus]
        Take me down to the Paradise City
        Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
        Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah, yeah
        Take me down to the Paradise City
        Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
        Take me home
